Description: README for TopoCreator website

TopoCreator is a web app designed to facilitate network topology creation. It
uses the vis.js JavaScript library for visualization.

Tips:
- Create nodes first, then subnets, then put nodes in subnets using the
  "Edit Subnets" page

- Click on nodes in the graph to edit their information

- Save topologies by "exporting" them; put a save name in the input box and
  click "Export", if no save name is given the input box will fill with the
  exported JSON.
